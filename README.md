##Detailed Application

Our group is planning on creating a database-focused web application. Since movies are one of the bright spots in everyday life, there should be a website that could really share the enthusiasm of cinema with friends and family. Issues with IMDB and other reviewer websites are that things are mostly individual and do not promote group involvement. The application we plan to make for this project is a movie reviewer app for friends and family. The goal is the app is to create a conversation with a group about movies only. Also, adding visuals of data such as rating charts, recommendations, and many more. For ratings, we would have seen when implementation whether a 5-star rating or 0 to 100 rating works for our web app. This way reviewing movies would be more of a group activity instead of writing a review and looking at all of the random reviews which is a tedious task. Hopefully, this web app creates a more joyful group experience in watching movies and having great debates.
We will let the user start by signing in and creating an account. They have the option to create a group. The user that creates the group becomes the group leader. Only the group leader is able to invite users to the group by username. Users in the group are able to add movies and rate the movies. Movies can be only rated once. Users may rate the movie by 1-100 or 5 stars, leave a like or dislike, and leave a comment. The movie page will visualize the rating data. The movie page may have more than 2 visualizations and random comments from one of the users.

##Implementation Plans

One or two paragraphs to explain your project implementation plans.
Every group will have to use PostgreSQL as the main DBMS for their project.
However, each group needs to explain what kind of Application Development technology you plan to use (PHP/JSP for Web APP, IOS/Android APPï¿½), which is totally your decision and you can select whatever technology you prefer to use.
For our web application, we will use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for front-end development. Also, use a visualization extension to help with making our application design more colorful and structured. We believe during implementation that we will use many extensions for the project. Back-end we will use Javascript and Node.js to connect to our PostgreSQL database. We also plan to use GitHub for our source code and project management. Since we have three team members, we will break things up into three parts such as one team member working on the front end and two members working on the back end for Javascript programming and database development.
The project plan is first to review web app features, programming languages, design, and resubmissions to the project. Next, review ERD and implement the diagram in a PostgreSQL database. Next, implement front-end and back-end code which will take most of the schedule. Next, connect the back end of the web app to the PostgreSQL database. Testing will come along through each period checking if features and connections are working. Also, looking for bugs that will dampen the user experience. Finally, check bugs and create a good presentation for the Professor.
